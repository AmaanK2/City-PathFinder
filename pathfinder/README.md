Pathfinder
Author: Amaan Khakiani

Rationale
The purpose of this sub-project is to provide an implementation of the pathfinder3 algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. By implementing this algorithm, we can provide users with a powerful tool for solving pathfinding problems.

Implementing a New Algorithm
Implementing a new algorithm is an important part of building a robust library. By providing users with multiple algorithms, we can offer flexibility and adaptability to a range of problems. In this case, the pathfinder3 algorithm is a good choice for pathfinding problems because it is efficient and reliable.

To implement the pathfinder3 algorithm, we first defined a ca.mcmaster.cas.se2aa4.a4.pathfinder.Graph ADT to represent nodes and edges. We then created an interface to define the public contract for finding a path between two nodes. Finally, we implemented the pathfinder3 algorithm and wrote unit tests to ensure its correctness.

With this sub-project, we hope to provide users with a powerful and reliable tool for solving pathfinding problems.
